Friend Finder

An app for finding your new best friend! All you have to do is fill out a quick survey!


-----------------------

This app is built with express servers. 

The problem was to figure out how to compare user data to an object containing potential friend data. 

By collecting all of the data and parsing it into integers, I was able to compare by iterating through each piece of data. Once completed the least amount of difference was stored into a global variable and when done, would push to the survey.html (through a modal) with your new best friend's name and image.
